# Microservices

This project provides examples of microservices patterns using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework.

Each example and each service has its own README file that explains how to start it and how to interact with the service / pattern.

You also have a complete Postman collection available in the root - `NAIS.postman_collection.json`, which you can import and use to make API calls to interact with services.
